# My-Mileage-Project
Investigated whether I drive more than the average American. Did this by collecting my daily driving mileage for 16 days.
I recorded my mileage in an Excel spreadsheet and then imported the spreadsheet into R for further analysis. Created visualizations of the data to
gain a deeper understanding of the data. I then performed a one-sample t-test to compare my average daily mileage to the current accepted population 
average daily mileage. I presented my findings to my data science class at Metro State University.
